The Elon Musk RPG - Year 2131
A post apocalyptic sci-fi RPG set on Mars, the future of mankind, led by their patron saint Elon Musk, must defend their last bastion of humanity from the alien plague, that turns humans into monsters.

Researchers from NASA discovered a glorious specimen with their probes to Jupiter, their discovery was not without cost however. It was far too late when NASA discovered they had also brought back an alien xenovirus, one that infected the host and turned them into hiveminded monsters, who only saught to spread the virus through contact, much like a typical "zombie virus". Before the world ended, our hero, Elon Musk "ol musky" saved a small portion of people by lifting them to Mars. Now we must defend our new home at all costs.
